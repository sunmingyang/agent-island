/// its exact value. Anthropic's rolling 5-hour reset_at drifts by seconds to
/// minutes on every poll while a window sits exhausted, so an exact-timestamp
/// dedup (what the earlier port shipped, matching mac 1.5.6) churned its key
/// every 5-minute refresh and re-fired the same "out of quota" alarm over and
/// over. We now track the latest boundary accounted for per window and only
/// re-alarm when a boundary jumps past it by more than ReArmMargin — real
/// resets leap hours (5-hour) or days (weekly); jitter never does.
///
/// When both of a provider's windows cross 100% in the same refresh they
/// collapse to one alarm for the binding window (the latest reset — the time
/// you're actually blocked until).
